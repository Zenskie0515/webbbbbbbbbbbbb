        <h1>Draizen's Autobiography</h1>

        <p>My name is <strong>Draizen Languban Gamet</strong>, but my friends and family usually call me <strong>Zen</strong>. I was born on <strong>May 15, 2007</strong>, in <i>Cabarroguis, Quirino</i>. I am the second child in the family of my parents,
            <strong>Romelia Gamet</strong> and <strong>Dante Gamet</strong>. I have two sisters—my eldest sister <strong>Daniela</strong> and my youngest sister <strong>Charlotte</strong>. We are not very close as siblings, but we care for one another
            and live a simple yet happy life together as a family. Even if we are not rich, we are always grateful because we have enough food to eat every day.</p>

        <p>I spent most of my childhood living with my grandmother in <i>Zamora, Cabarroguis, Quirino</i>. My mother worked abroad in <i>Lebanon</i> to support our family. Growing up without her beside me was not easy, but it made me strong and independent.
            My childhood was filled with simple happiness—playing with friends, going to the gym, and learning little lessons that shaped who I am today.</p>

        <p>I studied at <strong>Mangandingay Elementary School</strong> for elementary and continued at <strong>Cabarroguis National School of Arts and Trades</strong> for high school. Now, I am studying at <strong>Quirino State University – Diffun Campus (QSU)</strong>,
            taking
            <strong>Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT)</strong>. College is challenging but exciting because I know it will help build my future.</p>

        <p>I love listening to music, going to the gym, and learning about <i>trading</i>. Music inspires me, fitness gives me confidence, and trading opens my mind to opportunities in life.</p>

        <p>My dream is to have a career that gives me <strong>financial freedom</strong> and <strong>time freedom</strong>. I want to support my family and enjoy life at the same time. I also want to help others and share blessings when I become successful.</p>

        <p>One challenge I faced was being bullied for being thin. It hurt at first, but I used it as motivation to become stronger. I trained at the gym, became disciplined, and learned that people’s opinions do not define me—what matters is how I see myself.</p>

        <p>Right now, I am focusing on my studies and preparing for my future. Success takes time, but I believe that with <strong>hard work</strong>, <strong>patience</strong>, and <strong>faith</strong>, everything is possible.</p>

        <p>In the future, I want to inspire other people who feel weak or discouraged. I want to give back to my parents and make them proud. I want to live a life with purpose and help others improve their lives too.</p>

        <p>My message to the youth: <strong>Never give up</strong>. Work hard, stay consistent, and always believe in yourself. Even small progress matters as long as you keep moving forward.</p>

        <p>My life is still a journey. I am young, and I know there are many chapters to come. But I will continue learning, dreaming, and working hard to build a future that I will be proud of.</p>
